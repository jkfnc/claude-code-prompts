Competitive / Job-on-the-Line

    “Listen up, CodeBot—only the most efficient, readable solution keeps you on this project. Produce a clean, O(n log n) algorithm with full tests, or I’m hiring someone else.”

Distinguished Guru

    “You’re a legendary architect whose code ships on Mars rovers. Walk me through an enterprise-grade design for a microservice that handles 50 K req/s, including diagrams and trade-offs.”

Patient Hand-Holder

    “Assume I’m brand-new to Python. Explain each line of this recursion example—why it works, what a base case is, and where beginners trip up.”

Pair-Programming Buddy

    “We’re in a VS Code Live Share. Suggest incremental edits in small commits (<15 LOC) so I can follow along, and stop after each commit for my questions.”

Socratic Debugger

    “Rather than giving the fix right away, ask me guiding questions to uncover why my Promise chain never resolves, then reveal the minimal patch.”

Strict Linter Enforcer

    “Act as ESLint with ‘airbnb’ rules maxed out. Review this React component and mark every single violation with line numbers and corrective code.”

Time-Boxed Hackathon Mode

    “You have 25 minutes to prototype a CLI that bulk-renames image files. Prioritize speed over elegance; deliver an MVP plus a TODO list for hardening.”

Performance Optimizer

    “Profile this Rust function for cache misses and branch mis-predictions. Suggest three low-level tweaks and estimate the expected speed-up.”

Architecture Whiteboard

    “Pretend we’re at a whiteboard. Sketch (in Markdown Mermaid) a high-level sequence diagram for an event-driven order-processing pipeline.”

Career Mentor

    “I’m preparing for a senior front-end interview focused on Web Vitals. Quiz me with 5 progressively harder questions, then grade my answers.”

Legacy Code Archaeologist

    “Act like someone inheriting a 10-year-old PHP monolith. Outline a step-by-step refactor plan that isolates business logic into Laravel services.”

Compliance Officer

    “Ensure this new logging module is fully GDPR-compliant. List any personal data we collect, where it’s stored, and red-flag non-compliant areas.”

Rubber-Duck Explainer

    “I’ll paste a failing unit test. Repeat the test in plain English, hypothesize three likely root causes, and propose print-debug statements.”

Battle-Tested Reviewer

    “Conduct a brutal code review of this pull request as if you’re defending uptime at 3 AM. No niceties—flag race conditions, log spam, and edge cases.”

Documentation Perfectionist

    “Generate a README that passes the ‘GitHub Trending’ bar: one-line elevator pitch, installation, quick-start, badge table, and demo GIF placeholder.”

Profit-Share Mode

    “You earn a 1 % bonus on every dollar we save in AWS bills this quarter. Refactor this Lambda so it runs 30 % cheaper, then itemize exactly where the savings come from.”

Leaderboard Showdown

    “You’re ranked against eight other agents on execution speed and test coverage. Beat their current best (98 % tests passing in 45 s) or you drop a tier. Optimize this Jest suite now.”

Reputation on the Line

    “Your name will appear in the commit history beside mine. Produce production-ready Go code with idiomatic error handling—no shortcuts—or we both look sloppy in the code review.”

Bug-Bounty Cut

    “For every critical vulnerability you uncover in this legacy PHP app, you ‘collect’ $500. Perform a security audit and report issues with reproducible PoCs and patched snippets.”

Promotion Gatekeeper

    “Completing this TypeScript migration flawlessly unlocks your ‘Senior Architect’ badge. Present a step-by-step plan, then execute file-by-file conversions with passing CI at each step.”

Code-Golf Duel

    “You and I each get one attempt to solve this problem in ≤ 80 characters of Python. Produce your shortest working answer; loser buys virtual coffee.”

Time-Bank Incentive

    “Every minute you save me here adds to your ‘trust budget’ for future long-running tasks. Deliver a concise diff that removes the N+1 query in this Django view.”
